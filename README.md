# Dotfiles, and other things

My personal macOS dotfiles and other config.

## Installing

1. Install [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io) with `brew install chezmoi`
2. `chezmoi init dNitza`

## Thanks to
- Thoughbot for [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) (the tool I previously used to manage dotfiles)
